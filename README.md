# BuddyMemoryAllocator
A buddy memory allocator we had to implement for a project in our operating systems class

The main features of this allocator are in buddy.c.
It handles requests smaller than 4096 bytes using the buddy algorithm.

In test.c there are some tests and benchmarks


To run the tests, you can run 
```
make
```
